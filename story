One day, there were three siblings named Liz, Millie, and Sophia who were lost in a deep dark forest and had no idea on how to get out of there. So then, they kept walking and Sophia who was 12 years old and the oldest from two of her other siblings.
Sophia said in a mean way,” hey you two find out a way to get out from here”, sophia was too lazy to find out a way, not funny at all, and not really nice to her siblings too.On the other side, Millie and Liz were very smart unlike Sophia and they also thought of a name for her but they didn’t tell her cuz it was none of her business.
Anyways on with the story, millie and liz kept thinking, until millie said, we should keep walking maybe we find something that can help us out. After walking for like 5-10 minutes they found two paths but they didn’t know where they were gonna lead them too.Sophia was watching her phone on her data so she did not know anything and thought that she got lost.
